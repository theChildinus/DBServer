System Requirements
-------------------
1. Minimum memory - 256MB

2. Processor      - Pentium 800MHz or equivalent at minimum

3. Java SE Development Kit 1.5.13 or higher

4. The Management Console requires you to enable JavaScript of the Web browser,
   with MS IE 6 and 7. In addition to JavaScript, ActiveX should also be enabled
   with IE. This can be achieved by setting your security level to medium or lower.
  
   NOTE:
     On Windows Server 2003, it is not allowed to go below the medium security
     level in Internet Explorer 6.x and the default medium security setting with
     IE does not have sufficient levels of JavaScript and ActiveX enabled for the management
     console to run.

5. To build WSO2 Governance Registry from the Source distribution, it is also necessary that you
   have Maven 2.1.0 or later.
