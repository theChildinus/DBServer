1. INTRODUCTION

Spring LDAP is a library to simplify LDAP programming in Java, built on the same
principles as Spring Jdbc. 

The LdapTemplate class encapsulates all the plumbing work involved in traditional LDAP 
programming, such as creating, looping through NamingEnumerations, handling Exceptions
and cleaning up resources. This leaves the programmer to handle the important stuff - 
where to find data (DNs and Filters) and what do do with it (map to and from domain 
objects, bind, modify, unbind, etc.), in the same way that JdbcTemplate relieves the 
programmer of all but the actual SQL and how the data maps to the domain model.

In addition to this, Spring LDAP provides Exception translation from NamingExceptions
to an unchecked exception hirearchy, as well as several utilities for working with filters,
LDAP paths and Attributes.

As of version 1.2, support for client-side compensating transaction is provided, as well as 
Java 5 generics support with the SimpleLdapTemplate.

See changelog.txt for detailed information on the changes included in the current release.

4. MAVEN USERS

All major releases of this library are available in the central Maven repository.
Note that the artifacts have changed names between the 1.2.x and 1.3 releases:
spring-ldap is now spring-ldap-core
spring-ldap-tiger is now spring-ldap-core-tiger

Milestone releases (such as release candidates) are available from the Spring
framework milestone repo:

<repository>
  <id>spring-milestone</id>
  <name>Spring Portfolio Milestone Repository</name>
  <url>http://s3.amazonaws.com/maven.springframework.org/milestone</url>
</repository>
  
This means that in order to use the latest release (1.3.0.RC1), you need to
specify the repository above and include the following dependencies:

<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.ldap</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-ldap-core</artifactId>
  <version>1.3.0.RC1</version>
</dependency>

For Java 1.5 support:

<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.ldap</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-ldap-core-tiger</artifactId>
  <version>1.3.0.RC1</version>
</dependency>

Nighly builds are published to the snapshot repository:

<repository>
  <id>spring-snapshot</id>
  <name>Spring Portfolio Snapshot Repository</name>
  <url>http://s3.amazonaws.com/maven.springframework.org/snapshot</url>
</repository>

<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.ldap</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-ldap-core</artifactId>
  <version>1.3.0.CI-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>

For Java 1.5 support:
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.ldap</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-ldap-core-tiger</artifactId>
  <version>1.3.0.CI-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>

5. WHERE TO START

This distribution contains documentation and a sample application illustrating
the features of Spring LDAP.

A great way to get started is to review and run the sample application,
supplementing with reference manual material as needed. You will require
Maven 2, which can be downloaded from http://maven.apache.org/, for building
Spring LDAP. To build deployable .war files for all samples, simply access the
"samples" directory and execute the "mvn package" command. Alternatively, go
to a sample and run "mvn jetty:run" to run the sample directly in a Jetty 6 Web
container.
